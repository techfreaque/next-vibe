# AW Builder

AW Builder is an all-in-one build/bundle tool based on Vite and Rollup. It is designed to cover all your needs for bundling/compiling vanilla TypeScript, React, and React with Tailwind CSS. This tool is primarily intended for use within Anywhere Widgets TypeScript projects, including widget development and platform integrations.

## Installation

To install AW Builder, run the following command:

```bash
npm install builder
```

## Example Configuration

Create a file called `build.config.ts` in your project root with the following content and adjust it based on your needs:

```ts
import type { BuildConfig } from "builder";

const config: BuildConfig = {
  foldersToClean: ["./.dist"],
  filesToCompile: [
    {
      input: "./src/input.ts",
      output: "./.dist/output.js",
      options: { type: "vanilla-ts" },
    },
    {
      input: "./src/input.tsx",
      output: "./.dist/output.js",
      options: { type: "react" },
    },
    {
      input: "./src/input.tsx",
      output: "./.dist/output.js",
      options: { type: "react-tailwind" },
    },
  ],
  filesOrFoldersToCopy: [
    {

    {
      input: "./src/some_folder_with_stuff",
